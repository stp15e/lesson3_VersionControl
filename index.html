            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github is a web based Git repository service. Github hosts services ranging from free to paid hosting services. Github is commonly used by developers so that multiple people on a team can work on the same project, update and revise it without needing to send it around to all of the team members. While using Github, users create and modify files on their computer (local repository) and then they "push" it to Github (remote repository). When files are modified and sent to the remote repository the files are not overwritten, but rather are sent in as new files. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using Github developers deal with two types of repositories. These repositories are called the local repository and the remote repository. The local repository is the user's computer or the web based IDE that is being used to created and/or modify a file. The remote repository is a repository that a developer sends their files to as a backup and also as a way of versioning control. This way of storing files is very useful especially for development groups so that they can collaboratively work on projects without the need of physically being together.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Add</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using Git to add files to a user's remote repository or pull files from the remote to the local repositories, commands in the terminal are used. One of these commands is called Git add. When this command is used with a period, all new files or newly modified files are added to the staging area in preparation to being sent to the remote repository. Git add can also be used without the period. When Git add is used without a period, a user must state a file to send to the staging area.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using Git to add files to a user's remote repository or pull files from the remote to the local repositories, commands in the terminal are used. Another command that can be used is called Git commit. Git commit is the command that is typically used after the Git add command. This command is used to commit changes to files that were sent to the staging area from the local repository. This prepares the files to go to the remote repository. After files are commited the command Git push can be used to send them to the remote repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using Git to add files to a user's remote repository or pull files from the remote to the local repositories, commands in the terminal are used. Another command that is used in combination with Github is called Git status. Git status is used to view which files that have been changed since the last backup and which files that have already been added to the staging area in preparation of being pushed to the remote repository. A similar command to Git status is Git blame. Git blame displays who wrote each line of code in a file or who it is to be blamed for that particular line of code.
